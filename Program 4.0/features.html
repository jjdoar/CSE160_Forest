			Description: <br>
			I implimented a canvas which can spawn red and blue trees when left and right clicked<br>
			on. You can then select and deselect individual trees and translate, rotate, and scale them.<br>
			<br>
			I also implimented a point light which is represented by the yellow sphere.<br>
			The sphere can be translated using the same controls as the trees.<br>
			<br>
			The final thing I implimented is basic camera controls which allow for panning along all axis<br>
			as well as zooming in and out when in perspective mode.<br>
			<br>
			All three of the transformations work, but if you scale too quickly in either direction the other<br>
			trees will flicker and sometimes disappear. This can be fixed by slowly scaling in either direction.<br>
			This is also more or less likely to happen depending on how many trees are being drawn on screen.<br>
			<br>
			This program was created while running on Google Chrome.<br>
